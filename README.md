# scripts
Collection of various scripts that I find useful

## setup.sh
Sets up new Linux environment.

./setup.sh [OPTIONAL]

## checkWeather.sh

## number_headings.gs
I found this on a Google forum; it numbers headings found in a Google Doc as such functionality does not seem to be built in.

## cloc--git
Found on `https://stackoverflow.com/a/29012789`; this script counts the number of lines of code in a .git repository.
